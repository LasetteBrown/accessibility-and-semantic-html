## User Story
```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Accessibility
        
Accessibility is important for anyone using adaptive technology on a websight. For example, it allows people with visual impairments to be read descriptions of images and icons on the page using 'alt' tags and titles. Accessibility features also help improve the website's rankning on Google by making it accessible to a wider veriety of users. 

In order to improve the accessibility of this page. I made sure that all images and icons had alt tag descriptions. I also made sure that the page itself and the background image both had titles. I also made sure that all of the links at the top of the page functioned properly.

## Semantics

Semantic HTML is a more descriptive way of organizing a webpage. Using semantic tags indicates what the section actually is rather than using the same tag for every 'div'. For example, a 'p' tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and presentational because people know what paragraphs are, and browsers know how to display them. This also helps improve the accessibility of a webpage. 

In order to improve the samantics of this webpage, I made sure to change all 'div' tags to more descriptive Semantic HTML tags. I also cosolodated and updated the CSS to match these changes.
